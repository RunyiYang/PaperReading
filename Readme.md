# This is a catalogue of my paper reading notes

​	There are mainly 3 parts of my reading. 

​	The first part is mainly about Computer Vision where I'm concerned in most, I will try to read some classic paper intensively while do some paper reading extensively. 

​	The second part of my reading is something about Machine Learning. It's an enormous  topic. From that part I will read some classic and essential paper like NERF and Attention is all you need, to extend my vision and follow the routine. 

​	The third part is going to be about Robotics/Dynamics/Control Theory .etc.  I plan to only do some thesis study extensively in this part.

​	"*" means I think it's idea is brilliant.
