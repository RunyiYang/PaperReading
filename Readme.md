# This is a catalogue of my paper reading notes

â€‹	There are mainly 3 parts of my reading. The first part is mainly about Computer Vision where I'm concerned in most, I will try to read some classic paper intensively while do some paper reading extensively. The second part of my reading is something about Machine Learning. It's an enormous  topic. From that part I will read some classic and essential paper like NERF and Attention is all you need, to extend my vision and follow the routine. The third part is going to be about Robotics/Dynamics/Control Theory .etc.  I plan to only do some thesis study extensively.
